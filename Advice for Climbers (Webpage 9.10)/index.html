       Hello! And welcome to my website! This site is specifically for mountain climbers and adventurers who would like to partake in the daring challenge of climbing Everest. Way back when in the 1920s, the first humans decided to make the climb. It wasnâ€™t until 1953 that a successful climb was recorded. Since then, about 600-900 humans have successfully climbed a year. With a recorded number of 340 deaths. Seems low, as some deaths may not actually have been reported.If that isn't enough to scare you. This next number might. It is estimated to cost about $61,267 to climb in 2026. Sorry you canâ€™t climb this year, babe! You donâ€™t have all your permits, and I bet youâ€™re not even fully in shape yet. SO DON'T DO IT! That is my advice.
