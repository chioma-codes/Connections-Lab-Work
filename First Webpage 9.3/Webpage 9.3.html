        <h1> 👩🏿 HOW I MADE MY HEAD INTO A MAGIC 8-BALL 🔮 </h1>
        <h2> How a silly idea turned into my semester final</h2>
        <p> I started this project by casually messing around in Blender after scanning my face in the lab with a high-intensity $40k scanner. I also had the idea to create a nostalgic Magic 8-Ball that you could control in Blender using the gyroscope function within the Arduino. I thought that was a bit of a lackluster idea, so I decided to keep printing my head as a joke. Then my professor had the idea of combining the two ideas. Thus, the Magic 8 Chioma 3D printed project was born.
